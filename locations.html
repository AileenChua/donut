    <h2>Los Angeles</h2>
          <p>We spent several years living and working in Bed-Stuy and know the neighborhood quite well. We love the area for its historic richness and culture as well as a deep sense of community. Bed-Stuy was a natural choice for us in deciding to open our flagship store.</p><br>
          <p>We opened in December 2015 with a simple purpose: to make the best doughnuts we could! We knew we wanted to make a big doughnut, not just for the sake of it, but because it would be a celebration of it! We spoke a great deal about the texture and flavor we wanted to create and tested the dough recipe for months. Once we finally achieved what we wanted, we developed our flavors and opened quietly a few weeks after that. Through the testing we also realized that we wanted to make the doughnuts in small batches throughout the day so anyone that came to the store would experience the incredible joy of a fresh doughnut.</p>
